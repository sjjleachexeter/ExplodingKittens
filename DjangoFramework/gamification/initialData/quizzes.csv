Q002,M002,Which of these is NOT a stage?,"[""Packaging or retail"", ""Processing or manufacturing"", ""Raw ingredient sourcing"", ""Product price""]",3,Stages are real-world steps; price is not a stage.
Q003,M003,Where was the main ingredient of this product grown? (Example: chocolate bar),"[""Ghana"", ""Germany"", ""UK"", ""Brazil""]",3,Example quiz to teach that key ingredients can come from far away.
Q004,M004,Rank these evidence items from strongest to weakest support for a fair-trade claim:,"[""Fairtrade audit report \u2192 Supplier statement \u2192 Company webpage"", ""Company webpage \u2192 Supplier statement \u2192 Fairtrade audit report"", ""Fairtrade audit report \u2192 Company webpage \u2192 Supplier statement"", ""Supplier statement \u2192 Company webpage \u2192 Fairtrade audit report""]",2,Independent audits are strongest; supplier statements are usually weakest.
Q005,M005,What additional evidence is needed to properly support an organic claim (if only a supplier statement is provided)?,"[""Organic certification"", ""Nutrition label"", ""Retail invoice"", ""None of the above""]",0,A recognised organic certification or independent audit is stronger than a supplier statement.
Q006,M006,Is the 'sustainably sourced' claim supported by available evidence (if only a supplier statement is attached)?,"[""Yes \u2013 sufficient evidence"", ""No \u2013 evidence is too weak""]",1,Supplier statements alone are weak because they are not independent.
Q007,M006,Why is the evidence insufficient?,"[""Supplier statements are not independent"", ""Sustainability claims require third\u2011party audits"", ""Only one document is attached"", ""All of the above""]",3,All listed reasons contribute to the evidence being weak.
Q008,M006,What type of evidence is missing to better support the sustainability claim?,"[""Environmental audit report"", ""Sustainability certification"", ""Internal sustainability report"", ""Product photo""]",1,A recognised certification (or equivalent independent audit) is typically needed.
Q009,M007,Is an organic claim properly supported if the evidence is only: batch production record / shipping manifest / internal quality checklist?,"[""Yes"", ""No""]",1,Those documents do not prove organic certification or independent verification.
Q010,M007,What is the main problem with the evidence for an organic claim in this scenario?,"[""It is too old"", ""It is not independent"", ""It doesn\u2019t have a signature"", ""It is the wrong type of evidence for an organic claim""]",3,Different claims require specific evidence types; internal/shipping docs don't prove organic status.
Q011,M008,Which stage contributes the most value? (Example chocolate bar passport),"[""Cocoa farming"", ""Processing"", ""Manufacturing"", ""Packaging""]",2,"In the example, manufacturing is the highest value stage."
Q012,M009,"Which ranking is highest → lowest value contribution? (Example olive oil: 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%)","[""Olive farming \u2192 Pressing & filtering \u2192 Bottling \u2192 Branding \u2192 Retail"", ""Retail \u2192 Branding \u2192 Bottling \u2192 Pressing & filtering \u2192 Olive farming"", ""Olive farming \u2192 Bottling \u2192 Pressing & filtering \u2192 Branding \u2192 Retail"", ""Pressing & filtering \u2192 Olive farming \u2192 Bottling \u2192 Branding \u2192 Retail""]",0,Highest to lowest is 30% → 25% → 20% → 15% → 10%.
Q013,M010,Which stage is the biggest transparency risk? (high value + weak evidence),"[""Coffee farming"", ""Roasting"", ""Packaging"", ""Retail""]",0,"In the scenario, coffee farming has the highest value but only weak evidence."
Q014,M010,Why is that stage the biggest transparency risk?,"[""Because it happens first"", ""Because it has the lowest value"", ""Because it contributes the most value and has weak evidence"", ""Because it has many stages after it""]",2,Risk is highest when value contribution is high but evidence quality is low.
