## Layout & Navigation

### Bottom navigation (mobile):
On mobile, the application uses a persistent bottom navigation for core actions (Home, Missions, Scan, Leaderboard, Profile).
Icons are used instead of text to prevent wrapping on small screens.
Each icon includes an accessible label so functionality remains clear to screen readers.

### Top navigation (desktop):
On larger screens, navigation is displayed at the top to match common desktop conventions.
Core actions use both icons and text, as space constraints are reduced and readability is improved.

### Consistency across devices:
Both layouts use the same routes and page structure, ensuring consistent behaviour across devices.

## Responsive Design

Most users are expected to access the application on a phone, so the interface uses a mobile-first approach to support scanning and quick interactions on small screens.
On larger screens, layouts adapt to make better use of available space while keeping the same pages and interactions, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
