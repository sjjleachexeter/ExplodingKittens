Missions – Easy Missions

Goal: Help users learn through missions and quizzes.

1. First Scan
  • Scan any product and view its full product passport.
-->This helps the user understand the number of countries involved.
-->Users learn that multiple locations are involved.

Quiz:
What did the product passport show you?
• Product name and price only
• The product’s supply chain stages and evidence (correct answer)
• Marketing claims only
• Discount for next purchase


2. Multi-Stage
• Scan a product that has at least 3 different stages.
-->Teaches users that food products pass through multiple stages in different
countries before reaching the supermarket — not just where they are sold or
packaged.

Quiz:
Which of these is not a stage?
• Packaging or retail
• Processing or manufacturing
• Raw ingredient sourcing
• Product price (correct answer)

3. Main Ingredient Origin
• Scan a product and identify where the main ingredient was sourced or grown.
-->Helps users understand where the key ingredient in their purchase actually comes
from.

Quiz:
Where was the main ingredient of this product grown?
Example (chocolate bar):
• Ghana
• Germany
• UK
• Brazil (correct answer)
To complete the mission, the user must answer correctly.


Medium Missions

4. Evidence Match
• Scan a product that has evidence claims such as:
o Locally sourced
o Fair trade
o Organic
-->This teaches users that labels and marketing claims are only meaningful if backed by real
evidence.

Quiz:
If a user scans a coffee product claiming “fair trade”:
Rank these evidence claims from strongest to weakest support for the fair-trade claim:
1. Fairtrade audit report (correct order 1,3,2)
2. Company webpage
3. Supplier statement
-->This helps users understand that not all evidence is equal.
   
5. Missing Evidence
• Scan an item and identify what extra evidence is needed to support a claim.
-->Teaches users to recognise gaps in claim transparency.
1. Example:
Organic olive oil with only a supplier statement.

Quiz:
What additional evidence is needed to properly support this claim?
• Organic certification (correct answer)
• Nutrition label
• Retail invoice
• None of the above
-->Users learn that supplier statements alone are insufficient.

Hard Missions
6. Weak Evidence
• Scan a product where a major claim is supported by only one weak document.
Example: Chocolate claiming “sustainably sourced” backed only by a supplier
statement.

Quiz:
Is the “sustainably sourced” claim supported by available evidence?
• Yes – sufficient evidence
• No – evidence is too weak (correct answer)

Follow-up:
Why is the evidence insufficient?
• Supplier statements are not independent
• Sustainability claims require third-party audits
• Only one document is attached
• All of the above (correct answer)

What type of evidence is missing?
• Environmental audit report
• Sustainability certification (correct answer)
• Internal sustainability report


7. Wrong Evidence Type
• Scan a product with the wrong type of evidence.
Example: Organic claim supported by:
• Batch production record
• Shipping manifest
• Internal quality checklist

Quiz:
Is this claim properly supported?
• Yes
• No (correct answer)

What is the main problem with the evidence?
• It is too old
• It is not independent
• It doesn’t have a signature
• It is the wrong type of evidence for an organic claim (correct answer)
-->Users learn that different claims require different evidence.


Relative Value Missions & Quizzes

Easy Mission Example

After scanning a chocolate bar, the product passport shows:
**Stage**      **Role**               **Value contribution**

Cocoa farming   Raw ingredient source      High
 
Processing      Processing                 Medium

Manufacturing   Manufacturing              Very High

Packaging       Packaging                  Low

Retail          Retail Very                Low

Quiz:
Which stage contributes the most value?
• Cocoa farming
• Processing
• Manufacturing (correct)
• Packaging


Medium Mission Example
Olive oil product passport:

**Stage**                **Role**               **Value contribution**
Olive farming           Raw ingredient source           30%

Pressing & filtering    Processing                      25%

Bottling                Packaging                       20%

Branding                Marketing                       15%

Retail                  Retail                          10%

Task:
Rank stages from highest to lowest value (drag & drop).
-->Users learn that earlier stages usually matter more.


Hard Mission – Combining Value & Evidence

Scenario:
User scans a coffee product.

        **Stage**               **Role**       **Value contribution**     **evidence**
Coffee farming          Raw ingredient sourcing      Highest            Supplier statement

Roasting                      Processing               High               Factory audit

Packaging                     Packaging               Medium              Batch record

Retail                         Retail                  Low               Sales invoice


Q1: Which stage is the biggest transparency risk?
• Coffee farming (correct answer)
• Roasting
• Packaging
• Retail
Q2: Why?
• Because it happens first
• Because it has the lowest value
• Because it contributes the most value and has weak evidence (correct answer)
• Because it has many stages after it
