## Overview

### The System
The system is designed as a single backend application supporting multiple user-facing interfaces.  
The project defines three user roles (Player, Gamekeeper, Developer), each with distinct goals, workflows, and interaction patterns. Therefore, each role is modelled as a separate interface layer built on shared services and data
